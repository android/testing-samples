/**
 * JUnit4 test that uses a {@link ServiceTestRule} to interact with a bound service.
 * <p>
 * {@link ServiceTestRule} is a JUnit rule that provides a
 * simplified mechanism to start and shutdown your service before
 * and after the duration of your test. It also guarantees that the service is successfully
 * connected when starting (or binding to) a service. The service can be started
 * (or bound) using one of the helper methods. It will automatically be stopped (or unbound) after
 * the test completes and any methods annotated with
 * <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/After.html"><code>After</code></a> are
 * finished.
 * <p>
 * Note: This rule doesn't support {@link android.app.IntentService} because it's automatically
 * destroyed when {@link android.app.IntentService#onHandleIntent(android.content.Intent)} finishes
 * all outstanding commands. So there is no guarantee to establish a successful connection
 * in a timely manner.
